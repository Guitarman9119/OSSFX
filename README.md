Open Source Special Effects is to establish an online community for electronic enthusiasts and musicians to share and create guitar effects either through physical guitar pedal or software-related. The idea started from an open-source effects pedal based on an ARM development board.

**Arduino Uno Based effects pedal**

This pedal is based on the pedalshield Uno from electrosmash, with a few minor changes. This pedal does not include a bypass switch or LED indicator, but has enough to get you up and running programming. For schematics, PCB, code etc. check the repository
